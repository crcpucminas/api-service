# Spring Boot and Keycloack Simple Example

This is a simple app to be implemented with the developer community, to make my spring boot applications safer.

I created two simple examples using spring boot:

  - ##### API (to be secured): https://github.com/crcpucminas/api-service
  - ##### An API Client (which must access the api): https://github.com/crcpucminas/api-client

We would like to use keycloack (OAuth 2.0) to protect the API and grant access to API Client.

So, we need to do:

  - Configure keycloack (realm, hole, user, etc.);
  - Set the API configuration (application.properties); and
  - Set the API Client configuration (application.properties, configuration classes, etc.).
 
Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you very much.
